# GameNative


GameNative allows you to play games you own on Steam, Epic and GOG directly on Android devices, with cloud saves.

This is a fork of [Pluvia](https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia), a Steam client for Android.

## How to Use

(Note that GameNative is still in its early stages, and all games may not work, or may require tweaking to get working well)
1. Download the latest release [here](https://downloads.gamenative.app/releases/0.8.1/gamenative-v0.8.1.apk)
2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Login to your Steam account
4. Install your game
5. Hit play and enjoy!

## Building
### IF YOU JUST WANT TO USE THE APP, PLEASE SEE THE HOW TO USE SECTION ABOVE. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT.
1. I use a normal build in Android studio. Hit me up if you can't figure out how to build.
2. **SteamGridDB API Key (Optional):** To enable automatic fetching of game images for Custom Games, add your SteamGridDB API key to `local.properties`:
   ```
   STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Get your API key from: https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences
   If the API key is not configured, the app will log a message but continue to work normally without fetching images.
